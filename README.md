# CFRM-ES-CFU-XGBoost

Similar to Deep CFR and Poker-CNN (see papers below), this is an implementation of the External Sampling CFU (Probing) flavor of Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization, using XGBoost for the model(s).  The current tree generation is for Heads-Up Limit Poker.  

Disclaimer:  These are not 'best' programming practices (it's written in VB after all).  :)  I make no guarantees as it's function or performance (I haven't tested it with a GPU) and I take no responsiblity for how this code is used or misused.
